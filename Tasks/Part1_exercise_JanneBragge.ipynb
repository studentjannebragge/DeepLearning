    "In this notebook, you'll get introduced to [PyTorch](http://pytorch.org/), a framework for building and training neural networks. PyTorch in a lot of ways behaves like the arrays you love from Numpy. These Numpy arrays, after all, are just tensors. PyTorch takes these tensors and makes it simple to move them to GPUs for the faster processing needed when training neural networks. It also provides a module that automatically calculates gradients (for backpropagation!) and another module specifically for building neural networks. All together, PyTorch ends up being more coherent with Python and the Numpy/Scipy stack compared to TensorFlow and other frameworks."

There are various types of layers, but one of the most common is the fully connected layer, where every unit in the layer is directly connected to every unit in the previous layer.\n",

It introduces non-linearity to the model, enabling the network to learn complex patterns and relationships in the data. Without activation functions, the network would only be able to model linear relationships, limiting its effectiveness in solving real-world problems. There are many kind of activation function, but three of hte most important are ReLu, sigmoid, and softmax.**Foster, D. (2022)** \n",
